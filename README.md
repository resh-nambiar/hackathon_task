## 🌟 Project Overview

**[Project Name]** is a [short 1-line summary — e.g., *smart web app that uses AI to detect mental health patterns from journal entries*].

Our goal is to [describe what problem it solves and why it matters in 2–3 lines].

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

We noticed that [clearly define the issue or gap in existing systems].
This inspired us to build a solution that [briefly explain what your project does differently].

---

## 💡 Solution

Our solution [describe your core functionality in simple terms].
It helps users [main benefit] by using [techniques/AI/models/algorithms].

**Example:**

> We built an AI-powered dashboard that analyzes student stress levels from text and provides mood tracking with personalized suggestions.
